Recognizing ancient Tamil inscription characters enable archeologists to reveal 
historical events in ancient Sri Lanka. Currently, this is done by the archaeology 
experts with a huge effort. The inefficiency of this manual procedure will negatively 
impact on the future research in field of archaeology. This research involves in 
developing an application with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) functionality to 
recognize ancient Tamil inscription. This paper focus on the OCR module of the 
application OCR module comprises of the technologies of Artificial Neural Network 
(ANN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Experiments were carried out to 
evaluate the recognition rate of the two OCR technologies which performs on train 
data, test data (preprocessed) and test data (real images). After evaluating each OCR 
solution, CNN was selected as the best resulted OCR solution. Lack of data is the main 
limitation of this research and it will be highly impacted on the OCR accuracy
